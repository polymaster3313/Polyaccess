HOW DOES THIS WORK???


PolyC2 uploads the exe to the target computer ,executes the payload and gets the output.

I have given you two modules which are the decryptchrome and hello module

decryptchrome: decrypts chrome passwords and gets the output
hello: just prints hello world (its used for testing)


**THE PAYLOAD MUST NOT LAST MORE THAN 10s to get the output or else it will terminate payload**


**THE PAYLOAD MUST BE EXE**

BONUS: the sc file is just a small discription of the respective payloads (its optional)
